        'On-site': 'Employees are required to work in person at a physical office or location every day. ' +
            'This setup typically involves traditional office settings, factories, or retail stores. ' +
            'It allows for easier collaboration with team members, access to on-site resources, ' +
            'and a clear separation between work and home life. However, it may involve longer commute ' +
            'times and less flexibility, with the need to maintain a professional appearance throughout ' +
            'the workday.',
        'Hybrid': 'Employees split their work time between on-site and off-site locations, offering a balance ' +
            'of in-person and remote work. Typically, this means working from the office a few days a week and ' +
            'from home or another location on other days. This arrangement provides flexibility to choose the ' +
            'work environment based on tasks or personal needs, reduces commute times, and still allows for ' +
            'face-to-face collaboration. However, it requires good time management and self-discipline to adapt ' +
            'to different environments, and communication might require more coordination.',
        'Remote': 'Employees work entirely off-site, usually from home or another remote location, without ' +
            'needing to be present at a physical office. This setup offers maximum flexibility, no commute, and ' +
            'the freedom to work from anywhere with an internet connection. However, it demands reliable ' +
            'technology, potential discipline to avoid isolation, and the ability to set clear boundaries between' +
            ' work and personal life.'
